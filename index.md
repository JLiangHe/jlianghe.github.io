Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu//">Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University</a>, 
	working with <a href="https://zhuoranyang.github.io/">Prof. Zhuoran Yang</a>.
Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. in Statistics from <a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/aboutus/default.html">School of Management</a>, <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University</a>.  
Here is a copy of my <a href="assets/files/Jianliang-He.pdf">CV</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interests lie in statistics, machine learning and their intersection. If you share similar interests, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to conversations and excited about exploring new things. :-)
