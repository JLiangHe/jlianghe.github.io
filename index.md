Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu//">Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University</a>, 
	working with <a href="https://zhuoranyang.github.io/">Prof. Zhuoran Yang</a>.
Before joining Yale, I pursued my bachelor's degree in statistics from <a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/aboutus/default.html">School of Management</a> at <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University</a>.  
Here is a copy of my <a href="assets/files/Jianliang-He.pdf">CV</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on the intersection of statistics and machine learning. If you share these interests or simply want to chat, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new conversations and excited about exploring new topics. :-)
