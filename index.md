Hi! I am a undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/aboutus/default.html">Department of Statistics and Data Science, 
	School of Management</a> at <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University</a>, advised by
	<a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/AboutUs/preview.html?uid=012127">Prof. Bowen Gang</a>.  
	I'm also fortunate to be an intern at <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu//">Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University</a>, 
	working with <a href="https://zhuoranyang.github.io/">Prof. Zhuoran Yang</a>. Here is a copy of my <a href="">CV</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and machine learning. If you share common interests with me and are interested in potential collaboration or want to have a chat, feel free to contact me. Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and conversation :-)
