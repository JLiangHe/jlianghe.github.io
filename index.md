Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu//">Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University</a>, 
	working with <a href="https://zhuoranyang.github.io/">Prof. Zhuoran Yang</a>.
Before joining Yale, I pursued my bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/aboutus/default.html">Department of Statistics and Data Science, School of Management</a> at <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University</a>.  
Here is a copy of my <a href="assets/files/Jianliang-He.pdf">CV</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and machine learning. If you share common interests with me or want to have a chat, feel free to contact me. Iâ€™m open to conversation and excited about exploring new topics. :-)
